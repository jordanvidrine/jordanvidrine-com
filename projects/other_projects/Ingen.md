At the suggestion of a friend and mentor, I created this app to generate a static site from markdown files and handlebars template files. This project had me dive deep with the NodeJs file system module and I enjoyed working and manipulating user files on the system. This app is now functioning but is still a WIP.(Yes the name is based on Jurassic Park)
